Overview of the Project : Climate Change Belief Analysis 2022¶
Many companies are built around lessening one’s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.



Highlights of Projects
Globally, a number of companies are championing environmental sustainability and a reduced carbon footprints
Deduction of human perception about Climate Change and its threats
Strengthening of market research processes via human perception of climate change
Effects of human perception about climate change on their products and services

Problem Statements
Creation of a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data

Project Road Map
Analyse the supplied data
identify potential errors in the data and clean the existing data set
Determine if additional features can be added to enrich the data set
Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.
Evaluate the accuracy of the best machine learning model
Determine what features were most important in the model’s prediction decision
Explain the inner working of the model to a non-technical audience.
